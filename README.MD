# My First Django Project
### Game Stats
I'm happy to  present you with my first project.\
Main idea of the project was to create where you can keep track of statistics.
#### you can find there:
**Full CRUD**

**Models:** Player, Tank, Team, Clan, Game, and few others.

**Visually okay site**(mainly boostrap with some editing)

**Registering**, you can create user and\
be added automatically to the group called "New User""
upon creating second user,\
first created user will be **Super user**!

**Permissions**, since here I had no idea for the permissions, I made one group\
which has all the permissions and but aren't allowed to some things like:\
Editing existing game results, deleting them and generating **"Basic Data"**,\
as I did it for testing purposes, all of this is available for the **Super user**.

Have a nice day! (or night ! )
